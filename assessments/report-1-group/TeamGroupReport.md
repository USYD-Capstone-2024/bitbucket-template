## Usability Testing ##

Usability testing is a crucial part for the success of our project. Once a given requirement has successfully met the identified Acceptance tests, we test the requirement by placing it in the hands of an end user who does not have any prior knowledge of the system.

# Tools Used #
This section of the report outlines the tools used to develop the project.

## Programming Languages ##

**Summary**

* Python 3 (or above)

* C++

* Bash/Shell


## Database Tools ##
`TODO`

## Source Code Management ##
All of our source code is managed through BitBucket which utilises the Git language and ideas for capturing different versions of the code base.  The team has been using this as a means of keeping track of who is completing what tasks.  This is useful if there is a confusing change that occurs.

As part of the BitBucket system, there are extended features to Git, such as:

* **Issue Tracking**: This feature allows team members to link issues directly with the problems they are facing in the code, ultimately helping find, track and fix bugs in the software.  [More Info...](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-the-issue-tracker-221449750.html)

* **Wiki**: This feature is able to provide extensive documentation that can be either strongly or weakly linked with the code.  The Wiki uses markdown formatting to maintain a standardised format.  [More Info...](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-a-wiki-221449748.html)

* **Slack Integration**: BitBucket has the ability to send messages directly to a team slack channel.  This feature is useful for notifying team members that a change has been made to the repository.  [More Info...](https://mitcarraceteamd.slack.com/apps/A0F7VRDPE-bitbucket)


## Other Tools ##
### Slack ###
This is a communication tool that uses advanced encryption technologies but also provides convenient features for software developers to communicate.  This includes:

* **Advanced Instant Messaging**:  The instant messaging in Slack is very advanced.  Not only are team members able to use traditional text-based messaging but it offers features such as "tagging" of individual users or the whole team.  This will send out a notification directly to anyone effected.  It is also a convenient way to filter out messages not relevant to yourself.

* **Instant Image Uploads**: This feature lets users upload images or screenshots directly from their clipboard, avoiding the need to save the picture first.  This speeds up problem solving as team members can take a screenshot of their issue and someone can look at it and send back a solution.

* **App Integration**: (mentioned above) Slack has the ability for different apps to send direct communication into a particular channel on a Slack team.  For this project, BitBucket does uses this feature.

* **Channels**: Slack has a feature that allows for different topical conversations to be grouped into what are known as 'channels'.  This is a nice feature as it separates conversations and makes it easier to locate relevant information when required.
