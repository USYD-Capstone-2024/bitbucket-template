put clear links to the following documents:
 - deploying / setup environment for your code
 - docs for creating / modifying your simulator environment (adding tracks/worlds, vehicles, menu modification, etc)
 - docs for running your solution (TF: how to train a model and run, CV: how to run your code, Gazebo: how to launch)
 - any extra documentation created
 
 put all documentation into a folder called docs/ in your BitBucket repo and link here
 ```
